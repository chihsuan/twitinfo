The files in this directory build a naive bayes sentiment classifier.

Files:
train-nltk.py: run in a directory with two files: happy.txt and sad.txt,
and it will generate a BayesModel.pkl.gz which contains the pickled/gzipped
classifier.

test-nltk.py: will test BayesModel.pkl.gz on testdata.manual.2009.05.25
with cutoffs for positive and negative classification at different
probability cutoffs.  It reports the precision and recall of the
positive/negative classifier at different probability cutoffs.  Probability
cutoffs specify which probability a class (positive or negative) must be
classified before we believe the classification.  Otherwise, the classifier
should consider the tweet neutral/not give an answer.

package.py: saves the classifier as well as the parameters for the
classifier (positive/negative probability cutoffs, precision/recalls for
positive/negative classes at those cutoffs based on
testdata.manual.2009.05.25, and labels the classifier will use for
positive/negative/neutral classes).

testdata.manual.2009.05.25 is provided by
http://twittersentiment.appspot.com/, as is the training technique of
capturing ":)" and ":(" tweets on twitter to create happy/sad.txt.
sentiment.pkl.gz is a classifier which trained on 10k features
extracted from 650k happy and 650k sad examples.
