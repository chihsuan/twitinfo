We're working on documentation to get you started a bit easier.

In short, the code at https://github.com/mitdbg/twitinfo/tree/master/server
is a django app.  You can read about django apps at
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/

Two scripts help you actually get the data:
https://github.com/mitdbg/twitinfo/blob/master/server/index_tweets.py
[indexes tweets as they come in] 
https://github.com/mitdbg/twitinfo/blob/master/server/stream_tweets.py
[brings in tweets with the keywords you want to track]

As a sanity check for your setup working, after running "python manage.py
runserver 0.0.0.0:8000" you should be able to access
http://server_ip_address:8000/create_event to create an event to track.
